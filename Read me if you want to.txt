Hi there, Fraytooler.

If you're reading this... First of all, I'm impressed that you actually cared. 
Second of all, I know that this means you're at least a LITTLE interested in 
taking up the Dan mantle. I have no need to continue this creation myself, as
Dan (Despite being a really cool character that I use every so often) isn't a
character that I'm interested in developing any longer.

I have other stuff to attend to. Like school, Ryu, other projects unrelated to
Fraymakers... And I prefer on working on just one character at a time, really.
So I'm giving him away to the people that DO want to see him become a reality,
People who are real Dan fanatics unlike me. Maybe you fit into that descrip-
tion? I don't know, I'm typing all of this on August 26th and for all I know
The bloke (or lass) reading this could've downloaded this in DECEMBER.

So if you think you're up for the challenge, go ahead.

I've given you:
* A Few Animations (Mostly movement)
* Edited Stats
* A CSS Render
* Fighter Description
* The Sprite Sheet
* The link to the place where I've found the CVS sprites
  (https://spritedatabase.net/game/862)
* And permission to edit the already implemented sprites however you please

A good headstart for your first (or next) project, right? I hope that you will
Try to make this character the best character you can possibly make. Not 'cause
Benefits me, but because I believe in you and your potential.

Good luck out there!
Sincerest regards,
ObeliskWithLimbs.
